# loan_defaulters_EDA
This is Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the banking dataset. Aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a client has difficulty paying their installments which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc. This will ensure that the consumers capable of repaying the loan are not rejected.
